            As a word of growth advice, he emphasises the importance of fostering intrapreneurship in largecompanies
            by creating separate, independent units or teams with distinct processes. These divisions

            as exemplified by Hindustan Lever and Tata Steel. This strategy enables large organisations to remain
            agile and competitive while maintaining proper processes and procedures.
