                As a word of growth advice, he emphasises the importance of fostering intrapreneurship in largecompanies by creating separate, independent units or teams with distinct processes. These divisions
                operate autonomously, allowing them to innovate and take risks without jeopardising the core business,
                as exemplified by Hindustan Lever and Tata Steel. This strategy enables large organisations to remain
                agile and competitive while maintaining proper processes and procedures.
